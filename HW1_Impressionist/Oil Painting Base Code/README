I decided to take this class in order to get the capstone game dev certificate, and mobile certificate for cs.
I would like to learn more about lighting and particles in this class in oreder to create dynamic scenes in games
and any animated project I might do down the line of my career. Furthermore I got the examples to compile and run 
on UT cs machines but I was unable to get glew up an working on my home machine(Linux).
