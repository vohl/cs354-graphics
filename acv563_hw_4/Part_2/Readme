I created 4 different viewports that and frew the same object inside all four frames reseting the
Depth_Buffer_Bit before each viewport. I utilized the animateScenefunction from the source file rotateObject
to rotate the image being copied into every viewport. Than using the glLookAt function I changed where
the camera was pointing at for each viewport.
